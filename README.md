# klutz

**Disclaimer: Proof-of-concept software! Probably does not work most of the time.**

klutz compiles zepto modules to Clojure namespaces.
Named `klutz` because `clotz` is not a pun.

## Usage

Don't. If you insist, you can call `zepto klutz.zp <input-file>`. This will
print the rendered Clojure namespace to the standard output, which you can
then redirect to a file and load with Clojure.

## To Do

Probably a lot. I haven't tested it much and have no overview what works and what doesn't.
I'm pretty sure collections won't work yet.

Have fun!
